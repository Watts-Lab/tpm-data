01HP1Y7T39FNNFR8FEV6E6D7CR,but I think it wouldn't be fair to just cut C out,75.967,Organization A,01HP1Y2QHAACN68WX4N43DJVEB
01HP1Y7T39FNNFR8FEV6E6D7CR,"Right, that's why I don't really understand the purpose of this experiment lol",88.569,Organization B,01HP1Y1CSTMQ6K2DBS81YRMJKY
01HP1Y7T39FNNFR8FEV6E6D7CR,Obviously C wouldn't agree to that. Lol.,99.568,Organization B,01HP1Y1CSTMQ6K2DBS81YRMJKY

01HP1Y7T39FNNFR8FEV6E6D7CR,I think we should do ABC together and then because I and B have a superior strategy of doing us together we could split up the ABC together points 40/40/20,157.956,Organization A,01HP1Y2QHAACN68WX4N43DJVEB
01HP1Y7T39FNNFR8FEV6E6D7CR,I agree to that,159.446,Organization C,01HP1Y0MWA906TETZG7XWQFT16

01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,Hi there,23.909,Organization A,01HP1Y16VVS1V7QYHY8DWAWF4M
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,so Do we split 3 ways,34.183,Organization B,01HP1Y1VPEYFS2J7NRWWEN4ZGW
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,I think that splitting three ways is the best decision.,43.362,Organization C,01HP1XZZJ4SRJFRMWSYCFTQJCA
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,Seems to make sense. A good way to start!,49.921,Organization A,01HP1Y16VVS1V7QYHY8DWAWF4M
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,or A and B can split,51.164,Organization B,01HP1Y1VPEYFS2J7NRWWEN4ZGW
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,ok 3 ways,56.178,Organization B,01HP1Y1VPEYFS2J7NRWWEN4ZGW
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,"Yes, let's do 3 ways.",68.368,Organization C,01HP1XZZJ4SRJFRMWSYCFTQJCA
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,So what is the total that we'll be splitting?,80.907,Organization A,01HP1Y16VVS1V7QYHY8DWAWF4M
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,121/3,102.184,Organization B,01HP1Y1VPEYFS2J7NRWWEN4ZGW
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,"Yes, 121 between all 3 groups.",111.359,Organization C,01HP1XZZJ4SRJFRMWSYCFTQJCA
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,Got it. Sounds equitable to me.,111.913,Organization A,01HP1Y16VVS1V7QYHY8DWAWF4M
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,40.333333 points per organization?,128.915,Organization A,01HP1Y16VVS1V7QYHY8DWAWF4M
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,Yes that's correct. Apparently it should be rounded for us automatically.,146.359,Organization C,01HP1XZZJ4SRJFRMWSYCFTQJCA
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,two players can take 39 and one take 40 I think,163.185,Organization B,01HP1Y1VPEYFS2J7NRWWEN4ZGW

01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,"To streamline things, Organization A can take 39",201.91,Organization A,01HP1Y16VVS1V7QYHY8DWAWF4M
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,Or...your suggestion works great,211.911,Organization A,01HP1Y16VVS1V7QYHY8DWAWF4M
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,ok then A 40 . B 39 C. 39,227.203,Organization B,01HP1Y1VPEYFS2J7NRWWEN4ZGW
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,I am also okay taking 39.,231.351,Organization C,01HP1XZZJ4SRJFRMWSYCFTQJCA
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,If you all prefer 40,235.35,Organization C,01HP1XZZJ4SRJFRMWSYCFTQJCA
01HP1Y97BPHCB17H84CCDR5RC9,two players need 39 lets just go with A 40 B 39 c39,259.179,Organization B,01HP1Y1VPEYFS2J7NRWWEN4ZGW

01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"I think we should all work together, as that should be the way to maximize each of our benefits.  Any counters?",43.541,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,Not here,66.99,Organization B,01HP1XZQ7FXWF6XRCT0TFJXARF
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"Im fine with that, I just want to get this done in a timely manner even if it's not perfect.",70.565,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"Okay, great!",77.542,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"I'm not sure, but I think we need to fill in the deal sheet on the side to get the button to end negotiation early.",149.552,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,Do we all get the same payoff?,202.566,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"Yes, at least according to my info.  If you scroll allt he way to the bottom, there's a ""Schedule of Benefits"".",223.549,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,So 121 for each?,244.583,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"I hope so.  The way it's written sounds like we'd split it up, but from the instructions I believe it's for each.",285.547,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,Seems like it's splitting the total,299.975,Organization B,01HP1XZQ7FXWF6XRCT0TFJXARF
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"Yeah, that might be the case, and that would make more sense for why it would be a dilemma.",320.562,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"So, 40 40 41?",354.567,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"Heh, yeah, it's not an even split so I'm not sure who gets the extra 1",377.543,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,Perhaps it's more of a issue in other groups.,399.568,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,I will take the one if no one minds,407.584,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"Oh, I suppose that's what we're supposed to figure out and negotiate with who gets what amount",413.525,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"So in that case, if me and B were to work together and exclude C, we'd each get 59",448.542,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,Oh I get it.,463.568,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,You could exclude me to earn more.,481.568,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"We could, and this is the only interaction we have, but I'd feel bad if we were to do that",498.555,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,You would also have to do it directly in front of me in the chat,518.569,Organization C,01HP1Y08DBXCKSAN739DEV5NC0
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,"Ha, true!",523.554,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,We could all three agree to work together and then C could get a smaller amount so that way at least everyone gets something,553.536,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
01HP1Y6D73DF53A88HX2J1BJK9,Something like 45 - 45 - 21?,594.536,Organization A,01HP1XZX2XCSDKWAJEMV89ZQEX
