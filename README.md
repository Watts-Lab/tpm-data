# tpm_data
This is the repository for managing and cleaning data associated with the Team Process Mapping project.

The rough plan for its eventual development is as follows:
- **data_cleaning**/ → scripts for cleaning up the data; this should run in 1 click
    - One script per dataset
- **data_cleaning_dev/** → .ipynb’s for cleaning data and exploring different ways of cleaning it
- **raw_data** → original dataset formats
- **cleaned_data →** dataset after being processed (the ‘output’ folder for this repo)
